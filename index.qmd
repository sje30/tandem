This tandem is a great way of transporting children (approx 5-13
years) around and introducing them to cycling.  In the pictures the
rear seat is at its highest, close to adult height, but it can be
lowered to suit younger children with ease.  Highlights of the bike
include:

- hydraulic braking for excellent stopping.

- rear 3-speed internal hub coupled with 8-speed external derailleur.
  The rear hub means that you can easily change gear when stationary.
  
I've had this bike for about 8 years and it is still going strong.
Frame is in great condition - with just some signs of wear under the
front bottom bracket; one of the rear pedals is also missing a small
part of plastic.  Tyres are probably good for another few hundred km.
I've just checked over and cleaned/retensioned chains.


I'm selling this simply because my youngest is now 13 and is ready for
an adult tandem.  [Thorn](https://thorncycles.co.uk) is widely
regarded as an excellent tandem made in the UK; spares are readily
available from <http://sjscycles.com>.  A small passenger handlebar is
also included which might help younger riders.
